# Wellnut - Calorie Tracking App

## What is it?

This was my bachelorâ€™s degree application, that serves the purpose of tracking your macronutrients intake. I used C# (LINQ) and .NET Framework (Entity-Framework and ASP.NET MCV) for the back-end. The API integrated in this app is called TheMealDB.

## Why is it?

I wanted to improve my usage of C# and .Net Framework and this was the perfect way to do it. I also learned how to user LINQ, Entity-Framework and ASP.NET MVC.

## Challenges

It was my first time creating an ASP.NET MVC application, and I had to learn how the three components (Model-View-Controller) work.

## Technologies used

back-end: C# (LINQ), .Net Framework (Entity-Framework - to create the database and add migrations and ASP.NET MVC)
front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)

## Installation

Create a database and change the connection string found in /Web.config.
